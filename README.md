## About the program and developer<br>
<p>
At roughly ~15000 lines of code, this audio media player is my first full software <br> 
release and largest project to date. I chose javaFX as the base style to develop<br> 
in after spotting the Media object in my java textbook.<br>
<br>
While the textbook called for making a small Video player with a single button I wanted<br>
to use it to create a mp3 player to handle the music on my PC, since after updating<br>
my OS 4 years ago I have been lazy and neglected to re-install iTunes or any other music player
save VLC.<br>
<br>
What started as a music player project quickly developed into a file management system project.<br>
The actual music player and GUI only took a few weeks to put together and work properly. The real<br>
issue of reading, writing, and presenting audio file metadata within the javaFX GUI objects<br>
took about 2/3 of the project development time. I have no experience using winAmp, however I<br>
wanted to design this program similarly- to be as lightweight, simple, and accessible as possible.<br>
<br>
The release of this program is subject to update based on user interest, feedback, and bug reports.<br>
